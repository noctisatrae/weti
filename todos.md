- [x] implement Moralis provider (providers.go)
- [x] implement fetch provider (jobs.go)
- [x] implement insert queries (most important => implemented once for all providers | associate data with task id for easy retrieval)
- [x] Update data when the data of a job ID changed :)!
- [x] don't wait for the end of the ticker to check if the job is done
- [x] find a way to not add jobs already in the worker pool (pretty important to not fuck up resources management => DO IT ASAP)
- [x] Test if data updates work well (test deepEqual) => spoiler: **It doesn't**
- [x] test insert queries (not very important => go on)
- [x] test job expiration (kinda important to finish the backend)
- [x] implement .env / config loading (least important for now)
- [x] /watch response should be the id of the job not just a shitty generic unhelpful res (EASIEST & MOST IMPORTANT!)
- [x] prefix env variables so you don't pollute the environement with userspace crap
- [x] add a row to the job SQL relation to know which chainId to make the request on! (**choose provider endpoint from .env**)
- [x] better way to get providers => solve .env/config.toml (solve above first)
- [x] read through the codebase to see what's to be re-organized! (**separation of types and implementations - worth it?**)
- [x] containerizatin of weti-queue!
- [ ] solve todo jobs.go#l.111 (pretty important => equality of untyped structures **ASK FOR HELP ONLINE**)
- [ ] test parsing/loading/utils functions (config.Parse(), pgurl.go & **edgecases??**)
- - -
- [x] re-read doc + design UX to know which feature to build (get an idea at least)
- [ ] fetch token (historic) price to make a graph !
- [ ] clean error handling (too optimistic right now ahaha)
- [ ] fetch token images!
- [ ] good css to make it beautiful (shacdn/ui + v0)
