# todo
- [X] implement Moralis provider (providers.go)
- [X] implement fetch provider (jobs.go)
- [ ] implement .env / config loading (least important for now)
- [X] implement insert queries (most important => implemented once for all providers | associate data with task id for easy retrieval)
- [X] Update data when the data of a job ID changed :)!
- [X] Test if data updates work well (test deepEqual)
- [ ] solve todo jobs.go#l.111 (pretty important)
- [ ] test insert queries (not very important => go on)
- [X] don't wait for the end of the ticker to check if the job is done
- [ ] find a way to not add jobs already in the worker pool (pretty important to not fuck up resources management => DO IT ASAP)
